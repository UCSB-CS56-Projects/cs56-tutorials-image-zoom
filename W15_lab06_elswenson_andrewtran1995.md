// ISSUES
- Robot testing is flawed and needs to be refactored.
- Implementation of robot testing can be improved.
- Documentation can be clarified and much more thorough.
- TheGUI.java needs to be factored out into multiple files, easier to follow.
- Panning should not be allowed "infinitely" in any direction.
- Remove bugs: After the right sequence of button clicks, "Zoom +" and "Zoom -" will produce improper results.
